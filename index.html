    <h1>hi welcome to my website</h1>
    <p>my name is isaiah or izeeter or izlador or whatever honestly
        i dont really care. </p>
    <p>so i think im going to just use this little empty space on the internet
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
        as sort of like a place <br>where i can explain in detail some code ive written
        recently, and get better at javascript, html, and css. lol
    </p>
    <p>so yeah. uhh you know i was thinking about using markdown instead,<br>
        but idk. just kind of wanted to do it this way.
    </p>
    <p>like every single thing in my brain is saying "why are yuou just making a 
        bunch of new paragraphs just make it all one" <br>but honestly this is kind of
        like how my brain works so im just gonna keep doing ths.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>anyways expect rambling, tangents, ranting, venting, incorrect spellings, swearing, etc..</p>
    <p>this probably will not be entertaining, or fun to read. just thoughts of a poopy programmer.</p>
