**why.izeeter.lol is a website i'm currently working on and will hopefully be working on for as long as i live, it's a website i'm making to improve my javascript, html, and css skills. it's sort of a online journal of ideas, nothing too interesting in there unless if you're me.**

i don't know how github works really, that's also why im making this. for some reason git and source control have always been a struggle for me, but i want to improve so hopefully this entry will be updated in the future.
